According to the study, there are nearly 1 in 50 people
living with paralysis â€“ approximately 5.4 million people cross the U.S
And 21 million people are suffering with this problem in India.
Paralyzed patients with no body movement(Except eyes).These people
are dependent on others to do basic tasks like express their feelings ,
switch on/off light.

I  builded a software which a patient can control by just voluntarily blinking their eye. With the help of this software, patients can express their emotions , turn on/off the light, and they can make calls/ send sms.
